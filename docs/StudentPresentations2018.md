* The L-curve and its use in the numerical treatment of inverse problems - treasure chest ([presentation](StudentPresentations/L_curve_by_ChristianHolme.pdf), [write-up](StudentPresentations/Summary_ChristianHolme.pdf))
* Selecting the Number of States in Hidden Markov Models - Pitfalls, Practical Challenges and Pragmatic Solutions ([presentation](StudentPresentations/HMM%20presentation_SimonJohannes.pdf), [write-up](StudentPresentations/Hidden_Markov_Model__Advanced_Methods_Simon_Johannes.pdf))
* Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data ([presentation](StudentPresentations/xvm706-presentation.pdf), [write-up](StudentPresentations/xvm706-article-summary.pdf)) There was some interesting discussion about the applicability of some of the results from the paper; notably the lack of underfluctations in \alpha reproduced in slide 11, as well as the criteria that the x_{min} should be placed when the distribution is a power-law seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we set the x_{min} where the distribution exhibits power-law behavior, then it will exhibit power-law behavior. Maybe everything is okay, but it's still good to be critical and ask questions :-)
