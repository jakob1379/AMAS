        * On Thursday there will often be new material starting at 13:00
        * On Thursday it is very unlikely that any new material, lectures, or review will happen after 16:00.
* All classes will happen over ZOOM. The links can be found on the AMAS Absalon page.
* Odd-numbered classe are 4-hours while even-numbered consist of 2 blocks of 4-hours
* Classes will be composed of ~20-30% lecture and demonstrations followed by exercise
* While assignments, projects, and exercises can be done in the programming language of the students choice, the examples and demonstrations will be mainly in Python and/or scientific packages thereof, i.e. SciPy, NumPy, etc.
* Required text or textbooks: None
* Previous course pages:
    * 2016 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2016/)
    * 2017 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2017/)
    * 2018 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2018/)
    * 2019 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2019/)
    * 2020 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2020/)
* It is recommended, but not required, to have reviewed the `sibling' to this course, i.e. "Applied Statistics - From data to results" which can be found [here](http://www.nbi.dk/%7Epetersen/Teaching/AppliedStatistics2020.html)

## Evaluation {#evaluation}

The presentation, the problems sets, and the project will all be submitted and assigned from Absalon. So check Absalon for instructions and due dates. The final exam is handled by the eksamen webpage.

* **<u>Presentation and 1-2 page summary</u>** (10%)
* **<u>Graded problem sets</u>** (20%)
* **<u>Project</u>** (30%)
    * You may start working on **this right now!!**
* **<u>Final exam</u>** (40%)
    * 28 hour take home exam
    * The exam will be similar to problem set 2
        * A handful of more intensive questions as opposed to numerous short questions
        * While the exam will contain problems from any portion of the course material, the focus will be more on topics in the latter portion of the course
    * [Here](Slides/ExtraProblems.pdf) are two extra practice problems and the exams for [2016](Slides/Exam_2016.pdf) and [2017](Slides/Exam_2017.pdf)

## Course Syllabus

The course is 100% likely to change once we begin, and future lectures listed below serve as an outline. Even so, we **are very likely to** cover the following topics which may require additional software support:

* Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques including Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)
* The MultiNest bayesian inference tool
* Basis splines
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo
* Likelihood minimization techniques
* Spherical surface pixealization (HealPix)
