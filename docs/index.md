*   **<u>Presentation and 1-2 page summary</u>** (10%)
*   **<u>Graded problem sets</u>** (20%)
*   **<u>Project</u>** (30%)
    *   You may start working on **this right now!!**
*   **<u>Final exam</u>** (40%)
    *   28 hour take home exam starting on the morning of April 4 and ending on afternoon of April 5

## Course Syllabus

The course is very likely to change once we begin, and future lectures listed below serve as an outline. Even so, we **are very likely to** cover the following topics which may require additional software support:

*   Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques including Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)
*   The MultiNest bayesian inference tool
*   Basis splines
*   Markov Chain Monte Carlo
*   Likelihood minimization techniques
*   Spherical surface pixealization and isotropy (HealPix)
