## Basic Information

* Block 3 - Timetable A of the 2019 [academic calendar](http://www.science.ku.dk/english/student-life/studying-at-the-faculty/academic-calendar/)
    * Tues 08:00 - 12:00 and Thurs 08:00- 12:00 & 13:00 - 17:00
    * Actual
        * 08:30 - 09:00 Q&A or discussion with Jason in the classroom
        * **09:00** lecture on new material (not 09:05 or 09:15)
        * On Thursday there will very often be new material starting at 13:00
        * On Thursday it is very unlikely that any new material, lectures, or review will happen after 16:00.
* There are multiple locations depending on the day ([timetable](https://skema.ku.dk/tt/tt.asp?SDB=KU1819&language=DK&folder=Reporting&style=textspreadsheet&type=module&idtype=id&id=85288&weeks=28&days=1-5&periods=1-68&width=0&height=0&template=SWSCUST2+module+textspreadsheet)):
    * Tuesday is at oev - bib 4-0-17, Universitetsparken 1-3, DIKU
    * Thursday morning is at Aud 10, Universitetsparken 5, HCOE
    * Thursday afternoon is at Aud 06, Universitetsparken 5, HCOE
* Odd-numbered classes are 4-hours while even-numbered consist of 2 blocks of 4-hours
* Classes will be composed of ~20-30% lecture and demonstrations followed by exercise
* While assignments, projects, and exercises can be done in the programming language of the students choice, the examples and demonstrations will be mainly in Python and/or scientific packages thereof, i.e. SciPy, PyROOT, etc.
* Required text or textbooks: None
* Previous course pages:
    * 2016 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2016/)
    * 2017 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2017/)
    * 2018 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../../2018/)
* It is recommended, but not required, to have at least reviewed the little sibling to this course, i.e. "Applied Statistics - From data to results" which can be found [here](http://www.nbi.dk/~petersen/Teaching/AppliedStatistics2018.html)

## Evaluation {#evaluation}

### Oral presentation and 1-2 page summary (10%) {#oral-presentation} ###

* ~10 minute summary presentation. Plan on ~7 slides if you are doing a PowerPoint-type presentation.
* Can work alone or in groups of up to 3.
    * A 1-2 page summary including any and all group members names
    * I strongly encourage people to use LaTeX for the typesetting of the written summary. For those who do not already have a style, I would recommend trying the formatting style for submission to journals published by the American Physical Society [Downloadable here](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/journals/aps)
    * Presentation does NOT have to be given by all group members
* Talk or email with Jason if you have questions about the appropriateness of your article
* Be sure to put down which article you are using [here](https://alumni-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/xdn365_ku_dk/EQ4Tcjt-q11OkwajVCJC8P8Bm0Mtxg1JMoOi6et5O49cRg?e=BQV8Yg) to avoid duplication
* Example [presentation](Slides/OralPresentationExample_FiniteMonteCarlo.pdf) on [Finite Monte Carlo article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001046559390005W)
* Other example articles (and no, you cannot use any of these articles for your report/presentation):
    * Frequency Difference Gating: A Multivariate Method for Identifying Subsets That Differ Between Samples ([article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0320%2820010901%2945:1%3C56::AID-CYTO1144%3E3.0.CO;2-9/epdf))
    * Probability binning comparison: a metric for quantitating multivariate distribution differences ([article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0320%2820010901%2945:1%3C47::AID-CYTO1143%3E3.0.CO;2-A/full))
    * FIREFLY MONTE CARLO: EXACT MCMC WITH SUBSETS OF DATA ([article](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5693.pdf))
    * This is just a small sample. Ideally, find something related to your area of research.
* Include people names and article
* The 1-2 page summary as a .pdf file is due via email. Submission date is **March 6 by 16:00 CET**
* If you have any questions or concerns email Jason.

### Graded problem sets (20%) {#graded-problem-sets}

* Problem set 1 (5% of total grade)
    * Due: Feb. 13, 2019 by 08:30 CET
* Problem set 2 (15% of total grade)
    * Due: March 25, 2019 by 16:00 CET
    * [Partial Solutions for Problem Set 2](Slides/ProblemSet2_2019_solutions.pdf)

### Project (30%) {#project}

* Similar to the oral presentation, this project focuses on using a method or statistical treatment that is nominally related to your field of research that you or your group select. Unlike the oral presentation, the project includes not just understanding and explaining the method, but also using it on a some appropriate data set of your own choosing.
* Can be done alone or in groups of up to 3 people
* The only hand-in is a 4-6 page written report. You can submit the code as well if you would like.
* The project should be formatted and written as if it were a conference proceeding
    * Abstract, introduction, formatted figures w/ captions, citations, etc...
    * I strongly encourage people to use LaTeX for the typesetting. For those who do not already have a style, I would recommend trying the formatting style for submission to journals published by the American Physical Society [Downloadable here](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/journals/aps)
    * [Here](Slides/Text_Analysis_of_Danish_Texts_copy.pdf) is an example of a fantastic write-up from 2017.
* You may start working on **this right now!!**
* Due: April 2 by 22:00 CET

### Final exam (40%) {#final-exam}

* Must work on your own!
* Take home exam
    * 28 hour between start and submission
    * Begins at 10:00 CET on Thursday April 4, 2019
    * The exam must be submitted by 14:00 CET on Friday April 5, 2019
* The exam will be similar to problem set 2
    * A handful of more intensive questions as opposed to numerous short questions
    * While the exam will contain problems from any portion of the course material, the focus will be more on topics in the latter portion of the course
* [Here](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2018/ExtraProblems.pdf) are two extra practice problems similar to what has been on the previous exams
* Here is a link to the [2016 exam](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/Exam.pdf)
* Here is a link to the [2017 exam](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/Exam_2017.pdf)

### Extra Credit (+2% to final course grade average on a 1-100% scale) {#extra-credit}

* 2019 NCAA Men's Basketball Bracket submission due by tip-off of initial 1st round game on March 21
* This is NOT a requirement, nor is it an obligation for the course
* Information can be [found here](Slides/ExtraCredit_2019.pdf)
* Due: March 21, 2019

## Course Syllabus

The course is 100% likely to change once we begin, and future lectures listed below serve as an outline. Even so, we **are very likely to** cover the following topics which may require additional software support:

* Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques including Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)
* The MultiNest bayesian inference tool
* Basis splines
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo
* Likelihood minimization techniques
