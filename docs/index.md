## Basic Information ##

*   Block 3 - Timetable A of the 2017 [academic calendar](http://www.science.ku.dk/english/student-life/studying-at-the-faculty/academic-calendar/)
    *   Tues 08:00 - 12:00 and Thurs 08:00- 12:00 & 13:00 - 17:00
    *   Actual
        *   08:00 - 08:30 student study time for both Tues. and Thurs.
        *   08:30 - 09:00 Q&A or discussion with Jason in Aud. M
        *   **09:00** lecture on new material (not 09:05 or 09:15)
        *   On Thursday there will very often be new material starting at 13:00
        *   On Thursday it is very unlikely that any new material, lectures, or review will happen after 16:00.
*   Auditorium M at the Blegdamsvej campus
*   Odd-numbered classes are 4-hours while even-numbered consist of 2 blocks of 4-hours
*   Classes will be composed of ~20-30% lecture and demonstrations followed by exercise
*   While assignments, projects, and exercises can be done in the programming language of the students choice, the examples and demonstrations will be mainly in Python and/or scientific packages thereof, i.e. SciPy, PyROOT, etc.
*   Required text or textbooks: None
*   2016 Advanced Methods in Applied Statistics [webpage](../2016/)
*   It is recommended, but not required, to have at least reviewed the little sibling to this course, i.e. "Applied Statistics - From data to results" which can be found [here](https://www.nbi.dk/~petersen/Teaching/AppliedStatistics2016.html)

## Evaluation {#evaluation} ##

### Oral presentation and 1-2 page summary (10%) ## {#oral-presentation} ###

 *   ~10 minute summary presentation. Plan on ~7 slides if you are doing a PowerPoint-type presentation.
 *   Can work alone or in groups of up to 3.
     *   A 1-2 page summary including any and all group members names
     *   Presentation does NOT have to be given by all group members
 *   Talk or email with Jason if you have questions about the appropriateness of your article
 *   Be sure to put down which article you are using [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glEbVvsE8PNciT4GjrLqQCcBheVlwZ6Z0eim4ZYUPVI/edit#gid=0) to avoid duplication
 *   Example [presentation](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/OralPresentationExample_FiniteMonteCarlo.pdf) on [Finite Monte Carlo article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001046559390005W)
 *   Other example articles (and no, you cannot use any of these articles for your report/presentation):
     *   Frequency Difference Gating: A Multivariate Method for Identifying Subsets That Differ Between Samples ([article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0320%2820010901%2945:1%3C56::AID-CYTO1144%3E3.0.CO;2-9/epdf))
     *   Probability binning comparison: a metric for quantitating multivariate distribution differences ([article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0320%2820010901%2945:1%3C47::AID-CYTO1143%3E3.0.CO;2-A/full))
     *   FIREFLY MONTE CARLO: EXACT MCMC WITH SUBSETS OF DATA ([article](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5693.pdf))
     *   This is just a small sample. Find something related to your area of physics.
 *   Include people names and article [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glEbVvsE8PNciT4GjrLqQCcBheVlwZ6Z0eim4ZYUPVI/edit#gid=0) by March 3
 *   The 1-2 page summary as a .pdf file is due via email. Submission date is March 8 by 16:00 CET
 *   Presentations will be selected at random and begin during class time on March 9. At the discretion of Jason and if needed, some presentations will be postponed for a later date.
 *   If you have any questions or concerns email Jason

### **Graded problem sets** (20%)## {#graded-problem-sets} ###

 *   Problem set 1 (5% of total grade)
     *   [Description](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/ProblemSet1.pdf)
 *   Problem set 2 (15% of total grade)
     *   [Description](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/ProblemSet2.pdf)
     *   [Data file](data/ProblemSet2_Prob2_NucData.txt) filled with decay times for problem 2
     *   Due:Monday March 20 at 16:00 CET

### **Project** (30%) ## {#project} ###

 *   Similar to the oral presentation, this project focuses on using a method or statistical treatment related to your field of physics research that you or your group select. Unlike the oral presentation, the project includes not just understanding and explaining the method, but also using it on a some appropriate data set of your own choosing.
 *   Can be done alone or in groups of up to 3 people
 *   The only hand-in is a 4-6 page written report. You can submit the code as well if you would like.
 *   **Due: Monday March 27** at 16:00 CET

### **Final exam** (40%) ## {#final-exam} ###

 *   Must work on your own!
 *   Take home exam
     *   28 hour between start and submission
     *   Begins at 13:00 CET on Thursday March 30, 2017
     *   The exam must be submitted by 17:00 CET on Friday March 31, 2017
 *   The exam will be similar to problem set 2
     *   A handful of more intensive questions as opposed to numerous short questions
     *   While the exam will contain problems from any portion of the course material, the focus will be more on topics in the latter portion of the course
 *   [Here](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/ExtraProblems.pdf) are two extra practice problems similar to what will be on the 2017 exam
 *   Here is a link to the [2016 exam](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/Exam.pdf)
     *   Note that the 2017 exam will focus more on latter topics in the course than the 2016 version
     *   Also, the 2017 exam will be comparatively more difficult than the 2016 version

### **Extra Credit** (+2% to final course grade average on a 1-100% scale) ## {#extra-credit} ###

 *   2017 NCAA Men's Basketball Bracket submission due by tip-off of initial 1st round game on March 16
 *   This is NOT a requirement, nor is it an obligation for the course
 *   [Extra Credit Outline](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/ExtraCredit.pdf)

# Course Syllabus

The [outline](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2017/StatsSyllabus2017.pdf) is a rough sketch of the course material, and is 100% likely to change throughout the course. Even so, we **are very likely to** cover the following topics which may require additional software support:

*   Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques including Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)
*   The MultiNest bayesian inference tool
*   Basis splines
*   Markov Chain Monte Carlo
*   Likelihood minimization techniques
