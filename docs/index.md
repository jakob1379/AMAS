# Evaluation

*   **Oral presentation and 1-page summary** (10%)
    *   ~8-9 minute summary presentation. Plan on ~6 slides if you are doing a PowerPoint-type presentation.
    *   Can work alone or in groups of up to 3.
        *   A single 1-page summary including any and all group members names.
        *   Presentation does NOT have to be given by all group members.
    *   Be sure to put down which article you are using [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RgQ0ade6exn_yu5GH05Y2bUU1lSYwAqekj_Ic49WN3U/edit#gid=0) to avoid duplication
    *   Example [presentation](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/OralPresentationExample_FiniteMonteCarlo.pdf) on [Finite Monte Carlo article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001046559390005W)
    *   Other possible articles
        *   Frequency Difference Gating: A Multivariate Method for Identifying Subsets That Differ Between Samples ([article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0320%2820010901%2945:1%3C56::AID-CYTO1144%3E3.0.CO;2-9/epdf))
        *   Probability binning comparison: a metric for quantitating multivariate distribution differences ([article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0320%2820010901%2945:1%3C47::AID-CYTO1143%3E3.0.CO;2-A/full))
        *   FIREFLY MONTE CARLO: EXACT MCMC WITH SUBSETS OF DATA ([article](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5693.pdf))
        *   This is just a small sample. Find something related, interesting, or applicable to your area of research.
    *   The 1-page summary is <u>due</u> via email on March 9 by 17:00 (5pm) CET.
    *   Presentations will be selected at random and begin during class time on March 10. At the discretion of the Lecturer and if needed, some presentations will be postponed for a later date.
    *   If you have any questions or concerns email Jason
*   **Graded problem sets** (15%)
    *   Problem set 1 (5%)
        *   Deadline has now passed
        *   Grades have been posted on Absalon
    *   Problem set 2 (10%)
        *   Will be assigned sometime between March 7 and March 17
        *   **Due: Friday April 8** at 16:00 Copenhagen time via email to Jason
        *   [Problem Set 2 assignment](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/ProblemSet2.pdf)
        *   Solution(s) to Problem Set 2
*   **Project** (25%)
    *   Similar to the oral presentation, this project focuses on using a method or statistical treatment that is preferably related to your field of research that you or your group select. Unlike the oral presentation, the project includes not just understanding and explaining the method, but also using it on a some appropriate data set of your own choosing.
    *   Can be done alone or in groups of up to 3 people
    *   The only hand-in is a 4-6 page written report. You can submit the code as well if you would like.
    *   **Due: Friday April 8** at 16:00 Copenhagen time via email to Jason
*   **Final exam** (50%)
    *   Must work on your own!
    *   Take home exam
        *   28 hour between start and submission
        *   Start at 08:00 on **<u>MONDAY April 11</u>**
        *   <u>**Submit by 12:00 on Tuesday April 12**</u>
        *   If for some reason you are absolutely positive that there is no way you can do a 28-hour take home exam from April 11 to 12, let Jason know immediately.
    *   The exam will be very similar to problem set 2 and here is the simplest of [outlines](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/Proto-Exam.pdf) of what the exam may look like
    *   [Here](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/ExtraProblems.pdf) are two extra practice problems similar to what will be on the exam for those
*   Extra Credit (+2% to final course grade based on a 1-100% scale)
    *   2016 NCAA Men's Basketball Bracket submission due by 21:00 on March 17
    *   This is NOT a requirement or obligation for the course

# Course Syllabus

The [outline](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2016/StatsSyllabus2016.pdf) is a rough sketch of the course material, and is 100% likely to change throughout the course. Even so, we **will** absolutely cover the following topics which may require additional software support:

*   Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques including Boosted Decision Trees (BDTS)
*   The MultiNest bayesian inference tool
*   Basis splines
*   Markov Chain Monte Carlo
*   Likelihood minimization techniques
