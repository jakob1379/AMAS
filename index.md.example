# Evaluation

The presentation, the problems sets, and the project will all be submitted and assigned from Absalon. So check Absalon for instructions and due dates. The final exam is handled by the eksamen webpage.

*   **Presentation and 1-2 page summary** (10%)
*   **Graded problem sets** (20%)
*   **Project** (30%)
    *   You may start working on **this right now!!**
*   **Final exam** (40%)
    *   28 hour take home exam starting on the morning of March 27 and ending on afternoon of March 28
    *   The exam will be similar to problem sets 2 and 3
        *   A handful of more intensive questions as opposed to numerous short questions
        *   The exam will contain problems from any portion of the course material, excluding guest lectures unless otherwise noted.
    *   [Here](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2020/ExtraProblems.pdf) are two extra practice problems and the exams for [2016 ](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2020/Exam_2016.pdf) and [2017](https://www.nbi.dk/~koskinen/Teaching/AdvancedMethodsInAppliedStatistics2020/Exam_2017.pdf)

# Course Syllabus

The course is very likely to change once we begin, and future lectures listed below serve as an outline. Even so, we **are very likely to** cover the following topics which may require additional software support:

*   Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques including Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs)
*   The MultiNest bayesian inference tool
*   Basis splines
*   Markov Chain Monte Carlo
*   Likelihood minimization techniques
*   Spherical surface isotropy

Class notes will be posted here on this webpage as they become available.

**Optional Software Help Session (Jan. 29)**

*   14:00 - 16:30 in NBB 02.3.I.164
*   Optional session with the Teaching Assistant (Preet Bhanjan Pati) for any students who may need assistance with their computer software setup.
*   Get a preview with the course and some software tools to install.
